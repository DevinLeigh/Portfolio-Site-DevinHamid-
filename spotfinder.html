                        Spot Finder is a responsive web app that provides dog owners with the ability to find highly
                        rated dog-friendly businesses and other locations so they can plan outings and not need to leave
                        their dogs at home.

                    <h3>Research</h3>
                    <p>
                        User research was conducted to determine what features would be most useful to dog owners. Three
                        potential users were interviewed and the conclusions I drew from their feedback helped me to
                        create user personas, illustrating who I believe to be the target audience for this app and
                        further refining its function.

                        A User Flow was created to determine what screens needed to be included for the first iteration
                        and then exploratory sketching was done to come up with rough ideas of how each page might look.

                    <p>
                        Rough sketches were then made into a rapid prototype so that pain points could be identified
                        through a round of moderated user testing.

                    <p>
                        Once the desired mood of the app had been decided upon, a Style Guide was created to define the
                        colors, typography, and styles to be used.

                    <h3>Mockups</h3>
                    <p>
                        After receiving critiques from fellow designers, mockups could be created for all breakpoints
                        for XS, S, M, and L.

                        Spot Finder provides users with a single place where they can find all the information they’re
                        looking for when searching for dog-friendly locations within a chosen area, enabling them to
                        make the best decisions for their needs. As a responsive web app, it’s also accessible on
                        whichever device users prefer and have access to at a given time.
